v0.2.0
  * multi-user enabled. NOTE: this version is not backward compatible and
    requires rebinding your user settings based on the new system rather
    than using the `.env` enviroment file. (You still need an .env, but
    it no longer contains user information, only app-specific settings).
    Also note that you DO NOT have to downsync all your data, the way data
    is stored has not changed, so after setting up the user information
    the new version of FlickrMirror will host the same data as before.

v0.1.x
  * Everything before 0.2.0, really. There was no changelog until 0.2.0
